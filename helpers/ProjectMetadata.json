    "description":"t0wn aims to develop tools that enable digital communities of real people to connect. While these communities will still be online in the digital space, we also want to create a physical space for Web3 individuals to connect, share ideas, and innovate. This project aims to establish unique tools for crowdfunding to purchase this physical space. This space will be governed as a DAO by DAOs and Web3 orgs. ",
